								What different family tree chart formats are there, and why do they matter? This doesn’t refer to file formats for genealogy software; We’re referring different ways of displaying ancestry on screen or on
								paper. In fact, there are more than 20. Today, though, we’ll look in detail at the five that are the most useful to beginners.
								<br />
								The ‘Working Chart’ This was developed as a paper-based research tool, but it has plenty of digital counterparts. It isn’t fancy, but it is very fast and easy to use. Most ‘working chart’ varieties are little
								more than lines of boxes, with each line representing a rough generation. The idea is you write in the relevant names in each box – all siblings at that generational level – and draw the lines connecting
								boxes between generations manually.
								<br />
								The ‘All-in-One Chart’ Again, there are several versions of this chart, but that are all very similar. It is typically organised by generations, with boxes for each person and lines indicating marriage and
								descent. Practically speaking, it looks a great deal like the ‘working chart’, but there will be no blank boxes. The generational levels tend to become a bit jumbled as well, especially because real world
								families aren’t so simple and orderly as one imagines! Sometimes an all-in-one chart looks like a game of Scrabble, and that’s OK. The main point of an all-in-one chart is to display all of the data you have
								at once, and to highlight the different relationships between individuals. You can then develop other kinds of charts to focus on particular ancestors or particular family relationships.
								<br />
								The ‘Fan Chart’ The fan chart … well… looks like an old-fashioned folding fan. At the centre, where a real fan’s sticks would all come together in a handle is you (or the subject of the genealogy, anyway). In
								a small ring around the centre is the next generation up. Your parents. The next, larger ring is for their parents, your grandparents, etc. It doesn’t show any siblings at any generation, only the direct
								ancestors of one particular individual. It shows you all of your direct ancestors, usually out to at least 4 or 5 generations.
								<br />
								The ‘Descendant Tree’ This is almost the opposite of a fan chart, as it focuses on one person or couple far in the past, and tracks only all of their direct descendants. Sometimes, the spouses of their
								descendants are included as well, but not the ancestors of these spouses, nor any descendants these spouses produced with a non-descendent of the subject couple. Often, the person developing the descendent
								tree will still contrive to put themselves at the bottom centre of the tree, slightly mimicking the shape of the fan chart. However, the chart will still include many non-ancestors of this person, so they are
								not the same at all.
								<br />
								The ‘Pedigree Chart’ This chart is intended to show the complete ancestry of an individual, and is similar to a fan chart, except that the generations advance right-to-left instead of radially. Often,
								relevant details of each individual named on the chart are included, but it is rarely practical to include more than a few words about each. A variant of the pedigree chart has the ancestry of the subject’s
								mother on one side, and that of the father on the other. These can easily be mistaken for a championship league chart at first glance.
