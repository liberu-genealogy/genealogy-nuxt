								What is ‘Genealogy Scrapbooking’, and how to get started
								<br />
								A genealogy scrapbook or heritage album is to a family tree what a modern website (with all the bells, whistles and animations) is to a WW2 era newspaper. A family tree tells us the names of our ancestors and
								distant relations, and maybe lists a few important dates or relationships. A genealogy scrapbook tells us who these people actually were, and celebrates important aspects of their lives. A true heritage
								scrapbook won’t be constructed over a weekend. This is a long-term hobby, and one which can be handed down through the generations. It is not uncommon to have 2 or 3 generations of a family working on such a
								scrapbook simultaneously, making it a great way to share family stories and bond over discovering your roots.
								<br />
								So how does one get started? A heritage album can look like anything you want. Many people use commercial blank scrapbooks or photo albums. Some people find that they really enjoy scrapbooking, changing
								formats a few times over the course of a decades-long project. Start with something you feel comfortable using and exploring, and make changes precisely as you see fit. This is your family history, after all.
								Next, start doing your family research. Obviously, a site like family Tree 365 can be a huge help in the beginning. A detailed family tree forms the backbone of most heritage albums, and lets you know who you
								should be researching in order to find more pictures, news stories or even family legends. Then, speak to as many members of your family as possible, starting with the oldest generation. If you grandparents
								(or even great grandparents) are still around, they can be an incredibly detailed source of family history going back many generations. Not only will this bolster the family tree you just started researching,
								it will give you a sense of the story of your family going back generations. Remember that many of these older relatives will have pictures, letters and other memorabilia of their own grandparents or great
								grandparents, which they will likely let you scan, photograph or otherwise preserve in your own heritage album. Get your extended family involved. Set up a Dropbox or other accessible remote storage solution
								so that siblings, distant cousins, great aunts and even ‘Weird Uncle Harold’ can pool family history resources. Not only will this give you tremendous fuel for your own genealogy scrapbook, it will help them
								discover aspects of their own family history they might not otherwise have access too. Now, you can begin paring back your research to the most appropriate snippets. Less is more, as they say. You might have
								50 photos of your great grandparents and all of their children. You might have copies of all 200 letters a soldier sent home from a long war. You might have the surveyor’s report for your grandparent’s first
								home. Keep all of that, obviously, but don’t put it all in the genealogy album. One or two pictures, and 2 pages per family member will probably be enough. You can always include a mention that there is more
								‘in the archive’. Now you’re started. But the best thing is that the album will never be finished. It can be passed down and added to for generations.
