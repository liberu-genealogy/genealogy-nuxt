								What Is ‘Genealogy’, Anyway? Many people find this blog – indeed, this hobby – while exploring family tree research. With the increase in computerization of records today, it is easier than ever to find out
								about your roots. But is that the same thing as ‘genealogy’?
								<br />
								Genealogy defined Strictly speaking, genealogy is the study of, or an account of, the descent of a person or group from their ancestors. It can also be ‘an account of the origin and historical development’ of
								a family, person or object (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/genealogy). In that context, genealogy is pretty much synonymous with ‘family tree research’, it just sounds a little more ’proper and
								scientific’. Still, genealogy defines itself as a science, and it tries to follow procedures designed to make its findings more reliable. A great deal of family tree research is…. unreliable at best.
								Genealogy attempts to find proof of the family rumours and legendary links to famous people of the past. In that sense, it really is a more scientific approach.
								<br />
								What is ‘the genealogical approach’, then? Typically, genealogical research begins with a specific person or nuclear family, and traces their descent backwards through several generations. This is generally
								fairly easy at first, when people’s names and birthdays are still a part of living memory. Getting precise names and birth/death dates for your parents’ grandparents is usually possible, for example. Beyond
								that, you often need to delve into ‘proper research’. We’ll explore what that means in later pieces.
								<br />
								But what about collateral relatives? Neither family tree research nor ‘proper genealogy’ has to stop with the subject’s direct ancestors. Just as your cousins are a part of your family, the siblings of your
								direct ancestors and their own children are a valid part of your genealogy. Most ‘complete’ family trees include first, second, third and even fourth cousins of the subject, for example. Research into
								collateral family lines isn’t just idle curiosity or the ‘completist urge’ either. In researching collateral relatives, you can learn a tremendous amount about the family as a whole, and come to understand
								some of the stories and events which made your family what it is today.
								<br />
								Are there ‘professional genealogists? Are they more scientific about the whole thing? There are, and sometimes they take a much more hard-evidence approach. There are plenty of ‘experts in genealogy’ out
								there, all over the world. Some have been formally trained, but others are completely self-taught. Generally, speaking, if you expect to make any money offering genealogy as a service, you will be expected to
								follow very strict, conventional procedures for collecting and evaluating genealogical evidence, and in drawing conclusions from that evidence. There is also a lot of cross-over with other fields of science.
								Many professional genealogists have become experts in DNA testing and analysis as well (just as many trained DNA scientists haver developed expertise in genealogical research).
								<br />
								What is genealogy? Genealogy is organised, disciplined research into the ancestry of an individual, or of a family. It can be a very exacting, records-based research science. It can be supported by DNA
								testing and evidence. It can also be a casual hobby one engages in to explore your own interests and curiosity about your ancestors. Genealogy is precisely what you make of it.
